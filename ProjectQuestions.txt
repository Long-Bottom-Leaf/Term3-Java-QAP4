1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please estimate per problem if possible)

    Roughly 8 hours I would say.

2. What online resources did you use? (e.g., Lectures, YouTube, Stack Overflow, etc.)

    we3schools, chatGPT, copilot, personal notes, class videos

3. Did you get help from any classmates? (If yes, provide names; they must be enrolled in your class)

    Nope!

4. Did you ask for help from an instructor? (Mention the number of questions/help sessions)

    Nope!

5. Rate the difficulty of each problem and your confidence in solving similar problems in the future.

    I would say the project wasn't too difficult, just a lot of things to remember and implement. I feel a lot beter about Database and java after this QAP
